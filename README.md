# movielookup

To start up this project, you must have TMDB APIKey. 
Please create settings.js in ./source/assets.
Then put your constant values of APIKEY, BASEURL, and LANGUAGE you would like to view the app with.

```
var MYAPIKEY = "YOUR_APIKEY";
var BASEURL = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3";
var LANGUAGE = "en_us";

export { MYAPIKEY, BASEURL, LANGUAGE };
```


Have fun!
